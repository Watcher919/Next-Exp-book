## What are the criteria for adding a new book?
The mission of this list is to curate books that can change the lives of people for the better.

So you should add a book that has changed your life!!

Here are some questions that you can potentially ask yourself to help make this decision. If the answer is yes for most of them, feel free to create a pull request!

1. If you had the money to gift a book to every college graduate this year, would you gift this book?
2. Would you gift this book to your children at any point in their lives?
3. If there are only 3 books that you can keep a physical copy of in your life, would this book be one of them?
4. Would your life have been better off had you read this book 10 years back?
5. Would this book be relevant 1000 years from now?


## How to create a pull request?
- Search for existing books in [README.md](README.md) and make sure that you are not adding a duplicate.
- Insert the book in the following format in [README.md](README.md). Don't change any other files.
  `| Book name | Author | [Goodreads rating](Goodreads url) | Year published |`
- Make sure that the book is inserted in the correct order according to the Goodreads rating.
- Mention in pull request clearly why you think the book deserves to be on the list.

Thank you!
